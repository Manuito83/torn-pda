# Product Overview

Torn PDA is a cross-platform companion app for players of Torn City, giving them one place to act on their account from mobile devices. The app mirrors core Torn workflows (traveling, chaining, targeting, trading) while adding automation, reminders, and integrations with partner services such as YATA and Sendbird chat. Every feature aims to reduce context switching between browser tabs, Discord, and spreadsheets so players can react quickly on the go.

## Core Capabilities

- **Status-driven home** – Landing dashboard surfaces cooldowns, stats, finances, and shortcuts, tuned for notification-driven play.
- **Travel & chain copilots** – Arrival alarms, chain watcher, retaliation helpers, and faction coordination tools keep timers and priorities in sync.
- **Data integrations** – Pulls Torn API v1/v2 plus partner data (YATA, TAC, Sendbird, Firebase) and caches it for offline-friendly lookups.
- **Automation & alerts** – Background workers, native notifications, and widgets deliver energy/nerve warnings, stock updates, revive requests, and NPC loot alerts without opening the app.
- **Extensible scripting** – Built-in userscript engine (WebView + JS bridge) lets power users extend UI or call Torn endpoints within PDA’s sandbox.

## Target Use Cases

- Players managing travel, chains, raids, or faction support away from desktop.
- Traders tracking markets, item loads, and inventory with quick calculators.
- Support roles (revivers, scouts, faction leads) needing push alerts and shared target lists.
- Users who rely on user scripts or partner dashboards but want a consolidated mobile UI.

## Value Proposition

- **Single-pane mobile experience** endorsed by Torn developers, trusted by 40k+ players.
- **Automation-first workflows** that minimize missed timers, wasted resources, and manual math.
- **Interoperability with community tools** (YATA, TAC, Sendbird, userscripts) so existing processes plug in without rework.
- **Secure, permissioned Torn API usage** with rate-limited orchestration and native auth helpers.
