# TORN PDA

Torn PDA is an all-in-one assistant developed for players of [TORN City](https://www.torn.com). It aims to make playing Torn on mobile devices more convenient and enjoyable, offering a variety of tools to simplify tasks and enhance your experience.

Torn PDA was first released in May 2020, and since then it has been evolving to meet the needs of the community. It was originally developed for private use to solve simple issues like forgetting that I had landed already a few minutes ago (which often results in getting mugged), or managing chains without constantly switching apps. The app was later made public to help other players facing similar challenges.

It is officially endorsed by the developers of Torn (who also provide financial support for the servers used by the app for some applications), and as of the end of 2025 it is used by more than 50k players.

Torn PDA provides easy access to key game information and offers shortcuts to reduce the time needed for common actions. You can view stats, manage chaining targets, and even call for revives, all within the app. Below is a list of the main features Torn PDA offers to enhance your Torn experience.

You can see all the pending suggestions or developments on our [GitHub project board](https://github.com/users/Manuito83/projects/1) or join our discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vyP23kJ).
